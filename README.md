- Removes `%` characters (line-based)
- Preserves blank lines and formatting
- Extracts everything **before the first `O-word`** into `MDI.nc`
- Splits each program starting with `Oxxxxxx` into a separate `.nc` file
- Supports optional **inline comments** or **next-line comments** for program naming:
  - `O1234 (Finishing)` â†’ `O1234_Finishing.nc`
  - `O1234` followed by `(Finishing)` â†’ `O1234_Finishing.nc`
